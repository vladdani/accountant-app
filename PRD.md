üéØ Recommended Approach for us in terms of mobile and desktop:

Responsive Web App (Next.js)
‚Ä¢ Perfectly handles desktop interactions (drag-drop files, large screens).
‚Ä¢ Good enough on mobile browser (upload via browser from phone gallery).

PLUS

Thin Flutter Mobile App (Android)
‚Ä¢ Primarily optimized for WhatsApp workflow (forward/share files directly).
‚Ä¢ Native share extension (‚Äúshare to your app‚Äù) for instant file upload.
‚Ä¢ Offers ultra-convenient mobile experience for frequent daily use.

This ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù approach gives you maximum efficiency:
‚Ä¢ Web App covers desktops and occasional mobile web use (fast dev, low-cost maintenance).
‚Ä¢ Flutter App for dedicated mobile convenience and WhatsApp integration.

    Backend & DB:      Supabase (auth/storage/PGVector)

AI Extraction: Google Gemini API via Vertex AI

Frontend:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Web/Desktop: Next.js (responsive design)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Mobile: Flutter (lightweight, share-to functionality, WhatsApp integration)

‚Ä¢ Both frontends connect seamlessly via Supabase backend, so your data/AI extraction logic stays unified.
‚Ä¢ Same Supabase auth for web/mobile ensures seamless login across platforms.

    üì± UX Recommendations:

üöÄ Cursor AI Instructions (Ready to Paste)

Use the following clear instructions to build an MVP web app named ‚ÄúDigital Archive App‚Äù:

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Step 1: Project Initialization

Create a responsive Next.js (App Router) application named "digital-archive-app":

- Use TypeScript.
- Install and configure Tailwind CSS.
- Ensure ESLint and Prettier are set up.

If that module is already created in boilerplate, make sure to use it.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Step 2: Supabase Integration

- Integrate Supabase with your Next.js app.
- Create a new Supabase project named "digital-archive".
- Install the official Supabase JS library.
- Set up a Supabase client (/lib/supabaseClient.ts).

If that module is already created in boilerplate, make sure to use it.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Step 3: Authentication Setup (Magic Link + Gmail)

- Configure Supabase Authentication providers:
  - Enable Magic Link (email login).
  - Enable Google OAuth login.
- Create environment variables (.env.local):
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
- Implement authentication flow:
  - /auth page for login/signup.
  - Protected routes middleware (users must be authenticated).

If that module is already created in boilerplate, make sure to use it.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Step 4: File Upload (Drag & Drop)

- Implement a drag-and-drop file upload component (/components/FileUpload.tsx).
- Supported file types: PDF, CSV, XLS, JPG, PNG, HEIC.
- Files uploaded directly to Supabase Storage bucket named "documents".

If that module is already created in boilerplate, make sure to use it.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Step 5: Google Gemini AI (Vertex AI) for Data Extraction

- Integrate Gemini API for structured data extraction from uploaded files.
- Set GEMINI_API_KEY securely in .env.local.
- Create API route at /api/extract-data:
  - Receives document URL.
  - Calls Gemini API to extract:
    - Transaction Date, Amount, Supplier/Vendor, Item, Document type.
  - Saves extracted data into Supabase table "transactions".

If that module is already created in boilerplate, make sure to use it.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Step 6: Database Schema (Transactions)

Create Supabase Table: "transactions":

- id (UUID, primary key)
- date (timestamp)
- amount (numeric)
- supplier (text)
- item (text)
- document_url (text)
- type (invoice/receipt/other)
- uploaded_by (user UUID)

You‚Äôre right to be concerned. Let‚Äôs clearly address these two critical challenges and provide robust solutions that integrate well into your MVP.

‚∏ª

üö© Critical Challenge #1: Flexible Database Structure

Your documents vary significantly:
‚Ä¢ Invoices: date, supplier, invoice number, line items, total amount, tax details.
‚Ä¢ Agreements: parties involved, dates (start/end), terms, signatures.
‚Ä¢ Receipts: store/vendor, items bought, total amount, payment method.

A rigid, traditional database schema would limit your ability to store this variety effectively. You need a flexible solution.

‚úÖ Recommended Solution: Hybrid Structured + JSONB Approach (Supabase/Postgres)

Use a combination of structured columns for common fields and JSONB for flexible storage:

CREATE TABLE documents (
id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
type TEXT NOT NULL, -- invoice, agreement, receipt, etc.
date DATE, -- common across most docs
supplier TEXT,
document_url TEXT NOT NULL,
extracted_data JSONB, -- Flexible, stores varying fields per doc type
uploaded_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
uploaded_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users (id)
);

Why JSONB?
‚Ä¢ Flexible: Handles diverse document fields without changing schema.
‚Ä¢ Indexable: You can index specific JSONB paths for fast queries.
‚Ä¢ Scalable: Easy adaptation to new document types.

Example usage:
‚Ä¢ Invoice document

{
"invoice_number": "INV-12345",
"total_amount": 5500000,
"currency": "IDR",
"line_items": [
{ "description": "Air Conditioner", "quantity": 2, "unit_price": 2750000 }
],
"tax_details": { "ppn": "10%", "pph": "2.5%" }
}

    ‚Ä¢	Agreement document

{
"parties": ["PT ABC", "PT XYZ"],
"start_date": "2025-01-01",
"end_date": "2025-12-31",
"signatures": ["John Doe", "Jane Doe"]
}

This approach gives you full flexibility, easy maintenance, and powerful querying.

‚∏ª

üö© Critical Challenge #2: Multilingual Search (English & Indonesian)

Users may query in either English or Indonesian. Your search functionality must handle both effectively and quickly.

‚úÖ Recommended Solution: Multilingual Semantic Search using Embeddings

Implement AI-driven semantic search (vector embeddings) that inherently understands multilingual contexts.

Technical Implementation (Clear steps): 1. Embedding Generation:
‚Ä¢ For each uploaded document:
‚Ä¢ Extract raw text (via Gemini API).
‚Ä¢ Generate multilingual embeddings using Google‚Äôs Gemini multilingual models or OpenAI‚Äôs multilingual embeddings (text-embedding-3-large, Gemini embedding API). 2. Store embeddings efficiently (PGVector in Supabase):

ALTER TABLE documents ADD COLUMN embedding vector(1536);

    3.	Query Execution Flow:
    ‚Ä¢	User inputs query (in Indonesian or English).
    ‚Ä¢	Generate embedding of user query.
    ‚Ä¢	Execute semantic similarity search on embeddings using PGVector.

Example query (user types either language):

User query (Indonesian): "tampilkan invoice dengan nilai lebih dari 10 juta Januari 2025"
User query (English): "show invoices above 10 million from January 2025"

Supabase vector query example (fast and accurate multilingual search):

SELECT id, type, date, supplier, document_url
FROM documents
ORDER BY embedding <-> '[user_query_embedding]'::vector LIMIT 10;

Why this works effectively:
‚Ä¢ Embeddings inherently represent multilingual meaning.
‚Ä¢ No explicit language detection or complex NLP pipeline needed.
‚Ä¢ Blazing fast queries with vector similarity search in PGVector.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Step 7: AI-powered Chat Interface (Semantic Search)

Create a simple chat interface (/chat page):

- Users input natural-language queries (in Indonesian).
- Backend API at /api/query-transactions:
  - Uses Gemini API to parse user's query into structured search.
  - Executes Supabase DB queries on structured fields.
  - Returns neat, structured responses (transaction details, totals).
  - Provides clickable document links.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Step 8: Responsive Document Browsing

- Implement responsive document browsing (/documents page):
  - Recent uploads shown by default.
  - Folder/tree view by Year ‚Üí Month (expandable/collapsible).
  - Instant PDF viewer for document previews.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Step 9: Subscription Model & Stripe Integration

- Integrate Stripe subscription payments:
  - Plans: Standard, Professional, Enterprise.
  - Create Stripe products (monthly subscriptions).
  - API route /api/subscribe for subscription management.
  - Billing dashboard link (via Stripe customer portal).

If that module is already created in boilerplate, make sure to use it.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Step 10: Database Optimization (Fast queries)

Optimize Supabase queries for speed:

- Create multi-column index for quick queries (SQL):
  CREATE INDEX transaction_search_idx ON transactions (date, amount, supplier);
