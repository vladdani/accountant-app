# Semantic Search Implementation

This README explains the multilingual semantic search functionality in the Digital Archive App, how it works, and how to set it up.

## Overview

Our semantic search system enables natural language search across documents in both English and Indonesian.

## Testing

1. Upload documents to the system
2. Wait for processing to complete
3. Go to the dashboard and try queries like:
   - "Show me invoices from January"
   - "Find receipts from PT ABC"
   - "Documents between 2023-01-01 and 2023-12-31"
